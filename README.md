# Expression-2-Reaticulate

A very basic tool to convert Steinberg (Cubase / Nuendo / Dorico) Expression Maps (.expressionmap) to Reaper Reaticulate (.reabank) format.
Type in full path of your .expressionmap and the tool will create a .reabank in the same folder.
Currently only supports keyswitches.

Requires Python 3 + untangle lib
